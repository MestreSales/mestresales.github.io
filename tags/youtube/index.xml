Will try to transition to sharing on social media, as well. So, in the end, I can try to overcome at least a little bit of this fear.
You can find a link to my channel at the end of this post.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Yeap, I have a mix of the two. Got a late diagnosis and I am finding things about myself everyday. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to such depths, I just wanted to share this with you, and to make a little more sense of the &amp;ldquo;anxiety of being perceived&amp;rdquo; part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a fart sound to cut the seriousness&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="why-youtube">Why youtube
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s the least friction path to me, or at least it feels that way. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be posting there, and only sharing it here. This way, I&amp;rsquo;m consciously exposing myself without explicitly sharing with people that know me/perceive me on a daily basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is, without sharing it on other places. When I start to feel comfortable enough, I will start being &amp;ldquo;louder&amp;rdquo; with sharing this. Perhaps posting on my other social media&amp;hellip; It might not seem like a lot, but I am already feeling a tad anxious about posting all of this (as of now I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted this website yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>big sidetrack&lt;/strong>: I was going to put the &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not much, but it&amp;rsquo;s honest work&amp;rdquo; meme, because of the reference on the last paragraph&amp;hellip; But I just found out &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wsaz.com/2023/05/24/farmer-behind-viral-it-aint-much-its-honest-work-meme-dies-crash/?ref=okdoomer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>he died&lt;/a>, what the actual fuck, I&amp;rsquo;m shook&amp;hellip; R.I.P.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="my-first-video">My first video
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The first full-song that I properly learned on bass. Well, proper is a stretch, it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, I still can&amp;rsquo;t land the last harmonic. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite songs by Jaco Pastorius, I can get into that on another post. But here it is.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Weird sidetrack, still shook. Anyway, expect music-related stuff, because that is one of my hobbies. I play guitar and bass, and am attempting to arrange a setup to start to learn how to play drums.
This website, in a way, is also a way of exposing myself, and trying to conquer this fear. If you have anything you want so say, please let me know, I would love to read your thoughts ðŸ™‚&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
