I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating it with whatever I want to share with the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sick of social media and the way the algorithms prioritize the &amp;ldquo;for you&amp;rdquo; concept, and I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to feed it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this to keep a public journal for myself and, if you want, you can tag along 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I want to bring back personal blogs like in the era before the social media boom!!!!!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m employed within the computer science sphere, so I will also share my personal endeavors in that context. An overview of this website will soon follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to tag everything properly, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t be perfect right away. Just know that you can also &lt;a class="link" href="mailto:website@davidsales.pt" >e-mail me about anything&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This website will soon have a comments feature! I will work on it as fast as possible 🏃‍♂️💨&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
