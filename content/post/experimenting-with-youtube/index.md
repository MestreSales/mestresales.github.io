**TL;DR**: Using Youtube, and this website as well, to try and expose myself more. Will try to transition to sharing on social media, as well. So, in the end, I can try to overcome at least a little bit of this fear.
You can find a link to my channel at the end of this post.

## Yikes, I have AuDHD

Yeap, I have a mix of the two. Got a late diagnosis and I am finding things about myself everyday. I don't want to go to such depths, I just wanted to share this with you, and to make a little more sense of the "anxiety of being perceived" part.

Here's a fart sound to cut the seriousness

## Why youtube

Well, it's the least friction path to me, or at least it feels that way. I'm going to be posting there, and only sharing it here. This way, I'm consciously exposing myself without explicitly sharing with people that know me/perceive me on a daily basis. 

That is, without sharing it on other places. When I start to feel comfortable enough, I will start being "louder" with sharing this. Perhaps posting on my other social media... It might not seem like a lot, but I am already feeling a tad anxious about posting all of this (as of now I haven't posted this website yet).

**big sidetrack**: I was going to put the "it's not much, but it's honest work" meme, because of the reference on the last paragraph... But I just found out [he died](https://www.wsaz.com/2023/05/24/farmer-behind-viral-it-aint-much-its-honest-work-meme-dies-crash/?ref=okdoomer.io), what the actual fuck, I'm shook... R.I.P.

### My first video

The first full-song that I properly learned on bass. Well, proper is a stretch, it isn't perfect, I still can't land the last harmonic. It's one of my favourite songs by Jaco Pastorius, I can get into that on another post. But here it is.

## Wrapping it up

Weird sidetrack, still shook. Anyway, expect music-related stuff, because that is one of my hobbies. I play guitar and bass, and am attempting to arrange a setup to start to learn how to play drums. 
This website, in a way, is also a way of exposing myself, and trying to conquer this fear. If you have anything you want so say, please let me know, I would love to read your thoughts ðŸ™‚
