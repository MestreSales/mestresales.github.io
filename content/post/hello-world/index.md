Hi everyone, my name's David and this is my first post on the new website! I'll be updating it with whatever I want to share with the world. 

I'm sick of social media and the way the algorithms prioritize the "for you" concept, and I also don't want to feed it. I'm doing this to keep a public journal for myself and, if you want, you can tag along üôÇ

**I want to bring back personal blogs like in the era before the social media boom!!!!!**

I'm employed within the computer science sphere, so I will also share my personal endeavors in that context. An overview of this website will soon follow.

I will try to tag everything properly, it probably won't be perfect right away. Just know that you can also [e-mail me about anything](mailto:website@davidsales.pt)!

This website will soon have a comments feature! I will work on it as fast as possible üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®
